Optimizing Production Capacity for Giant Motor Company Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

This repository contains an optimization model for Giant Motor Company (GMC), focusing on strategic production capacity planning. Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), the model helps determine the optimal level of capacity expansion and flexibility in GMCâ€™s manufacturing plants.The case study explores retooling options for existing plants to balance fixed costs, production efficiency, and demand forecasts across three vehicle models: Lyra (subcompact), Libra (sporty compact), and Hydra (luxury).
It also incorporates demand diversion effects, where unmet demand for lower-tier models may shift to higher-tier models.

This project demonstrates how mathematical optimization aids in corporate decision-making, ensuring cost-effective production while maximizing profitability.
